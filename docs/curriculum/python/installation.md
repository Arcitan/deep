# Installing Python

!!!tip "Use the [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ricedatasci/deep/master) links to avoid installation and just use a web browser!"
 
    [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) is a service that provides remote
    jupyter sessions for quick experimenting.  It uses
    [repo2docker](https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker) to create an
    environment from a git repository. :tada:

## Anaconda

The Anconda Distribution is a pretty solid bet if you don't already have Python
installed: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
