    [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) is a service that provides remote
    jupyter sessions for quick experimenting.  It uses repo2docker to create an
    environment from a git repository. :smile: :tada:


## Anaconda

The Anconda Distribution is a pretty solid bet:

## Environments

Anaconda has a concept of an "environment", which is a self-contained workspace
which isolates different projects dependencies.  

For example, you might have an environment dedicated to a specific project, or
type of programming.
